## Employment History

### EPIK - Assistant English Teacher (Aug 16' - Aug 18')

During the two years, I worked as an English Teacher in Seoul, South Korea teaching elementary grade students. 

My responsibilities included:
*  Creating lesson plans and activities to supplement the school curriculum in a multi-level classroom. Activities included:
    *   Making worksheets
    *   Powerpoint presentations
    *   Creating interactive games
*  Plan and produce 3 weeks long English camps for students during winter and summer vacation. This was a great opportunity to create a theme and story for the camp, so that students are able to enjoy and gain more by attending these camps.
*  Share different cultural experiences. The students are able to learn a lot about the differences in Korean and Western culture, this makes the English lessons much more immersive for the students as they are able to discuss real life experiences with me.
