## Front End JavaScript Developer.

Formerly a student of [Founders & Coders](https://foundersandcoders.com/).

With academics in design, I have a keen interest in UI/UX. Studying web technologies has been important in improving the UX of the projects I have worked on through browser optimisation, including load times and accessibility features. With the tools in programming, I aim to provide users with an efficient and enjoyable experience.

## Projects
### [Grandparents Plus](https://github.com/fac-13/GP_ProjectBernadette/)
A client project for weeks 10-12 of the Founders and Coders bootcamp. In an Agile team of four, we created an app for a charity called [Grandparents Plus](https://www.grandparentsplus.org.uk/). 

> Grandparents Plus is the only national charity (England and Wales) dedicated to grandparents and their role in the care and development of their grandchildren.

Most users arrive at their website not knowing that they could potentially be entitled to benefits as a kinship carer. Grandparents Plus wanted a product that allows older users of the website to find the information they need, and to also provide awareness that they may be kinship carers.

My role as UX was to collaborate closely with the PO to ensure that the project vision and goals were clear. With this clarity I was able to work with my team and support the members in the design aspects of the application.

### [Well Bean](http://well-bean.herokuapp.com/)
A student project for weeks 10-12 of the Founders & Coders bootcamp. In a team of four, we created an app that provides small challenges focusing on improving the daily routine of users, to provide a healthy lifestyle in small gradual changes. 

The application has several main features. Users were able to sign up and log into their accounts so that challenges could be selected and the progress could be saved. We also wanted to create a positive community by allowing people to inspire, by sharing short messages to users nearby anonymously. Users can also upload their own challenges, these would be moderated before being shared to the community.

My role as UX was very interesting in this project. I was also the PO of the application and so a lot of the vision and design aspects were between me and the rest of the team. I ensured that the team had a large contribution in the design of Well Bean.

I was also in charge of planning the user testing phase, finding users to test our product and also prepare the questions to be asked.

## Employment History

### EPIK - Assistant English Teacher (Aug 16' - Aug 18')

During the two years, I worked as an English Teacher in Seoul, South Korea teaching elementary grade students. 

My responsibilities included:
*  Creating lesson plans and activities to supplement the school curriculum in a multi-level classroom. Activities included:
    *   Making worksheets
    *   Powerpoint presentations
    *   Creating interactive games
*  Plan and produce 3 weeks long English camps for students during winter and summer vacation. This was a great opportunity to create a theme and story for the camp, so that students are able to enjoy and gain more by attending these camps.
*  Share different cultural experiences. The students are able to learn a lot about the differences in Korean and Western culture, this makes the English lessons much more immersive for the students as they are able to discuss real life experiences with me.
